      - | **Relativistic effects, redshift space distortion, galaxy assembly bias, galaxy groups**
        | I am an astrophysicist working on two broad aspects of the universe. On one side I am interested in the small scale non-linear physics, in particular questions of galaxy formation and evolution especially focusing on the connection between galaxy properties and host dark matter halos including AGN activity. This has the potential to unveil the true physical nature of what is called Dark matter. On the other side, I am interested is cosmologically large scale, working on galaxy redshift survey to probe Dark energy and general relativity. I have focused on interpreting and extracting information based on galaxy dynamics perceived by a telescope. I have studied various dynamical and environmental effects on the galaxy spectrum and how those can help us make a more precise measurement of the content of the universe with novel tests of general relativity. This involves the understanding of cosmological theory, analyzing complex and large data and searching best fit parameter of the models with high-dimensional parameter space.

      - | **Stellar halo, galaxy-halo connection**
        | I am interested in how galaxy properties and their processes vary with dark matter halo mass and dark matter assembly history. In 4MOST, I am most interested on one hand in the connection between inferred dark matter halo masses from group catalogs and how they vary with galaxy properties.

      - | **Photometric redshifts, weak lensing, large-scale structure**
        | I study the large-scale structure of the Universe and its luminous tracers - galaxies. I am interested in how matter clusters on the largest cosmic scales and how this affects the propagation of light originating both from galaxies and from the earliest epochs of the Universe, visible today as the cosmic microwave background. I work with wide-angle catalogs of galaxies and use various computer science techniques, such as machine learning, both to identify the galaxies, and to estimate their distances via the so-called photometric redshifts.

      - | **Galaxy evolution; galaxy physical properties; dark matter in galaxies; emission line in galaxies**
        | I am broadly interested in galaxy evolution, what galaxies can tell us about stellar evolution, and how we can use spectra of galaxies to infer their (stellar, nebular etc) physical properties. More recently I have become interested in the dynamics of nearby galaxies and what this can tell us about dark matter.

      - | **Galaxy evolution, agn, cosmology, integral field spectroscopy**
        | My primary research interests are in observational cosmology. A key theme is to make experimental tests of galaxy formation models. One of my approaches to this has been the investigation of the nature of supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. A second approach is the use of spatially resolved spectroscopy to survey thousands of galaxies using new instrumentation technology. Another research theme has been the observational measurement of fundamental cosmological constants and testing of cosmological models via large-scale surveys. My research involves both large-scale surveys and detailed investigations of small samples and individual objects.

      - | **Galaxy evolution, circumgalactic medium, hydro simulations**
        | I am interested in using 4HS data to study the properties of galaxies within large-scale structures such as groups and filaments, and using the data to compare to and constrain galaxy formation models, particularly the Simba simulations but also others.  I am also interested in connecting the galaxy properties with properties in other wavelengths, as well as studying galaxy--black hole co-evolution through AGNs.  Simba's unique and highly successful input physics makes it an interesting testbed to help interpret and contextualise 4HS data within a cosmological context.

      - | **Cluster galaxy evolution, sf quenching, pre-processing**
        | What physical processes determine whether a present galaxy is star-forming or quiescent? When, where and how are previously star-forming spiral galaxies transformed into quiescent galaxies by their local environment, whether that be a massive cluster, a galaxy group or as a satellite to a more massive galaxy? How important is pre-processing of galaxies within group-mass halos for building up the population of quiescent galaxies in local clusters? What are the physical mechanisms that are actually transforming galaxies within groups?

        | My focus is on using the properties of the large-scale velocity and density fields for designing and  convening novel tests of LCDM and beyond-LCDM models. A connected aspect is a study on how the LSS cosmic fields is acting as a galaxy formation and evolution environment and how this affect the galaxy properties. Finally, I am also interested in Dark Matter models (Warm, Cold, self-interacting) and the associated effects on the Local Universe galaxy and dark matter properties.

      - | **Weak lensing; large-scale structure; observational cosmology**
        | My main area of research is observational cosmology, with a particular focus on the study of dark matter and dark energy using weak gravitational lensing. To obtain the maximum of information from large imaging surveys such as Euclid and LSST, we need to improve our understanding of the galaxy-halo connection. This is where 4MOST can provide key information, both on galaxy properties as well as the environment.

      - | **Cosmology, peculiar velocities, large-scale structure, transients**
        | I work on making maps of the positions and motions of millions of galaxies in our Universe to uncover how it has evolved since the Big Bang, as well as the properties of ellusive Dark Matter and Dark Energy. My research sits at the interface of observation, theory and simulation. Within 4HS I'm lead of the Peculiar Velocities and Cosmology science working group and am particularly interested in using the data from 4HS to make the most complete and detailed map of galaxy positions and motions in our Universe to date, to test different models of gravity, and to identify the hosts of future Type Ia supernovae and gravitational waves. I'm also a working group chair in the DESI and WALLABY surveys, so hope to combine these in the future with 4HS to obtain an almost unimpeded view of the local Universe.

        | I have two main interests in 4HS. 1) To use 4HS to reconstruct the large scale structure in the Southern Hemisphere and compare predicted peculiar velocities with the Fundamental-Plane-based peculiar velocities that 4HS will measure. 2) To cross-correlate Euclid and Rubin weak lensing probes of dark matter with the 4HS redshifts to understand topics such as the galaxy-halo connection and its dependence on environment and the dark matter structures of galaxy group and cluster halos,  filaments of the cosmic web and cosmic voids.

        | I am interested in galaxy evolution in groups and clusters, with a particular focus on the most massive early-type galaxies. I use optical spectroscopy to measure stellar kinematics as an indicator for different evolutionary paths and merger histories. From the spectra I also probe stellar populations to infer possible star formation histories. I am also interested in synergies between optical and radio galaxy surveys, particularly for groups and clusters.

I mostly focus on the study of their stellar populations, morphologies and kinematics, and the relation with their black holes. I base most of my science on looking for peculiar types of galaxies such as relic galaxies, ultra diffuse galaxies and compact galaxies at all stellar masses.

      - | **Galaxy evolution, weak gravitational lensing, survey astronomy**
        | As an observational astronomer specialising in galaxy formation and evolution, I work primarily on galaxy census projects, with the broad goal of shedding light on the astrophysical processes that drive and regulate the formation and evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.  My first research focus is in empirical studies of 'galaxy demographics': that is, detailed statistical descriptions of the distributions of properties (e.g. mass, size, age, growth rate) across the general galaxy population. This includes addressing fundamental questions like: How many galaxies exist in the present day universe?; How does the number of galaxies in the universe grow over time?; How are galaxies’ sizes (or shapes, colours, ages, or growth rates) correlated with their masses?; What are the similarites and differences between galaxies found in dense clusters, or smaller groups, or relative isolation?. One question that I am particularly interested in is: When and why do the most massive galaxies stop forming new stars? Another major research focus of mine is in pioneering new techniques for precision measurements of the dark matter that surrounds galaxies, and using those new techniques to shed light on the role that the dark matter plays in shaping and influencing the evolution of galaxies.

        | Cosmic web detection and characterisation in galaxy redshift surveys. I have been working on algorithms to detect galaxy groups and to estimate galaxy group masses. For galaxy filament detection I have developed the Bisous model, which models the filamentary network as a marked point process. In galaxy evolution, I am interested what is the influence of cosmic web filaments and how galaxies are connected and aligned with filaments and groups.

      - | **Galaxy evolution, environmental effects, spatially resolved spectroscopy**
        | My major research interest is to understand the most important factors that drive galaxy evolution through cosmic time, trying to disentangle and quantify the importance of galaxy mass, redshift and environment. My research is based on a combination of integrated and/or spatially resolved spectroscopy and photometric data. I have been focusing on characterizing the history of stellar evolution and structure development of galaxies in different environments, by tracing the star formation rate, morphology and total stellar mass of galaxies at different redshifts.  I am particularly interested in understanding how the galaxy stellar mass distribution can be affected by the environment in which galaxies reside, contrasting the role of the global and local environments. Making use of spatially resolved data, I also investigate which are the typical patterns left on the gas and stellar distribution by the different physical mechanisms affecting galaxies in the different environments.
